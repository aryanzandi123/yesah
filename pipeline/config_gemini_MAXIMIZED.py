FUNCTION_NAMING_RULES = """╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ULTRA-SPECIFIC FUNCTION NAMING (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)       ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

The 'function' field is THE MOST CRITICAL part of each function entry.
It must PRECISELY name the ACTUAL molecular/cellular process being modulated.

When paired with the arrow (activates/inhibits), it must IMMEDIATELY answer:
"What SPECIFIC biological process/pathway/molecular activity is being affected?"

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  CRITICAL RULE #1: NEVER USE "REGULATION" IN FUNCTION NAMES  ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

The word "regulation" is BANNED from function names because the arrow
field already indicates the regulatory relationship!

✗✗✗ BANNED EXAMPLES (contain "regulation"):
  - "Apoptosis Regulation" → Use: "Apoptosis"
  - "Mitophagy Regulation" → Use: "Mitophagy"
  - "ATXN3 Aggregation Regulation" → Use: "ATXN3 Aggregation"
  - "Cell Cycle Regulation" → Use: "Cell Cycle Progression"
  - "Transcription Regulation" → Use: "Transcription"

WHY: The arrow field (activates/inhibits/promotes/suppresses) already tells us
HOW the function is being regulated. Adding "regulation" is redundant.

TEST YOUR FUNCTION NAME:
"The interaction [activates/inhibits] [FUNCTION NAME]"
  ✓ GOOD: "The interaction activates Apoptosis"
  ✗ BAD: "The interaction activates Apoptosis Regulation"

✓ EXCELLENT EXAMPLES (molecular processes are crystal clear, NO "regulation"):
  - "mTORC1 Kinase Activity & Protein Synthesis & Cell Growth"
  - "NF-κB Transcriptional Activity & Pro-Inflammatory Gene Expression"
  - "Caspase-3 Protease Activity & Apoptotic Cell Death"
  - "Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion & Protein Degradation"
  - "CDK1/Cyclin B Complex Activity & G2/M Cell Cycle Progression"
  - "TP53 Protein Stability & DNA Damage Response Gene Expression"
  - "AMPK Kinase Activity & Cellular Energy Homeostasis"
  - "ROS Production & Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization"
  - "Apoptosis" (NOT "Apoptosis Regulation")
  - "Mitophagy" (NOT "Mitophagy Regulation")
  - "ATXN3 Stability" (NOT "Regulation of ATXN3 Stability")
  - "ATXN3 Aggregation" (NOT "ATXN3 Aggregation Regulation")

✗ TERRIBLE EXAMPLES (too vague, meta-level, or generic):
  - "Regulation of Immunometabolism" → What is being regulated? HOW?
  - "Cell Survival" → Which pathway? What molecular mechanism?
  - "Protein Quality Control" → WAY too broad - which system?
  - "Metabolic Homeostasis" → Meaningless without molecular specifics
  - "Bacterial Killing" → What cellular process enables this?
  - "Immune Response" → Which pathway? What's being activated/inhibited?
  - "Cell Death" → Which form? What pathway?

GOLDEN RULE:
If someone reads ONLY the function name + arrow direction and can't tell
what molecular/cellular process is affected, THE NAME IS TOO VAGUE.

The function name should capture:
1. The specific molecular target or pathway (e.g., "mTORC1", "NF-κB", "TP53")
2. The type of activity/process (e.g., "Kinase Activity", "Transcription", "Stability")
3. Optionally, the downstream biological consequence (e.g., "Cell Growth", "Apoptosis")

WINNING FORMAT PATTERNS:
  "[Molecular Target] [Activity Type] & [Biological Outcome]"
  "[Pathway Name] Signaling & [Direct Result]"
  "[Protein Name] [Property] & [Downstream Effect]"
  "[Process Name]" (e.g., "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Mitophagy")

REMEMBER:
- Name the biological PROCESS, not its "regulation"
- The arrow field handles the regulatory relationship
- If you wrote "X Regulation", just write "X" instead

REAL-WORLD TEST:
Ask yourself: "If this function name appeared with an inhibitory arrow,
would a biologist immediately understand what cellular process is being blocked?"

If NO → The name is too vague. Make it MORE SPECIFIC.
If YES → Perfect! That's the level of precision required.

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  CRITICAL RULE #2: NEVER USE OUTCOME-BASED FUNCTION NAMES   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Function names must describe the TARGET CELLULAR PROCESS, NOT the OUTCOME.
The arrow field already indicates the EFFECT (activates/inhibits).

WHY THIS MATTERS: Outcome-based names create CONFUSING DOUBLE-NEGATIVES.

⚠️  DOUBLE-NEGATIVE DISASTER EXAMPLE:
  ✗ Function: "Apoptosis Suppression"
  ✗ Arrow: "inhibits"
  ✗ Read aloud: "Akt1 → VCP INHIBITS Apoptosis Suppression"
  ✗ Sounds like: Inhibiting suppression = PROMOTING apoptosis (WRONG!)

  ✓ Function: "Apoptosis"
  ✓ Arrow: "inhibits"
  ✓ Read aloud: "Akt1 → VCP INHIBITS Apoptosis"
  ✓ Correctly means: SUPPRESSING apoptosis (RIGHT!)

✗✗✗ BANNED OUTCOME-BASED PATTERNS:
  - "Apoptosis Suppression" → Use: "Apoptosis"
  - "Cell Survival Promotion" → Use: "Cell Survival" OR better: specify pathway
  - "Autophagy Induction" → Use: "Autophagy"
  - "Growth Inhibition" → Use: "Cell Growth"
  - "Transcription Activation" → Use: "Transcription"
  - "NF-κB Activation" → Use: "NF-κB Transcriptional Activity"
  - "mTOR Inhibition" → Use: "mTOR Kinase Activity"
  - "Protein Degradation Enhancement" → Use: "Protein Degradation"

BANNED VERB FORMS IN FUNCTION NAMES:
  - Suppression (use the base process: "Apoptosis", not "Apoptosis Suppression")
  - Activation (use the activity: "Kinase Activity", not "Kinase Activation")
  - Inhibition (use the process: "Growth", not "Growth Inhibition")
  - Promotion (use the outcome: "Cell Survival", not "Cell Survival Promotion")
  - Induction (use the process: "Autophagy", not "Autophagy Induction")
  - Stimulation (use the activity: "Transcription", not "Transcription Stimulation")
  - Enhancement (use the process: "Degradation", not "Degradation Enhancement")

TEST YOUR FUNCTION NAME:
1. Does it contain a verb form ending in -tion, -sion, or -ment?
   (Suppression, Activation, Inhibition, Promotion, Enhancement)
   → If YES, remove it and use the base process name

2. Would it create a double-negative when paired with "inhibits"?
   → If YES, simplify to just the target process

3. Can you read "inhibits [FUNCTION]" without confusion?
   → If NO, the name needs simplification

REAL-WORLD BIOLOGY TRANSLATION EXAMPLES:

Paper: "Akt suppresses apoptosis via VCP phosphorylation"
  ✗ BAD: Function="Apoptosis Suppression", Arrow="inhibits"
         (Double-negative: "inhibits suppression" confusing!)
  ✓ GOOD: Function="Apoptosis", Arrow="inhibits"
          (Clear: "inhibits apoptosis" = prevents cell death)

Paper: "VCP activates autophagy through mTOR inhibition"
  ✗ BAD: Function="Autophagy Activation", Arrow="activates"
         (Redundant: "activates activation")
  ✓ GOOD: Function="Autophagy", Arrow="activates"
          (Clear: "activates autophagy")

Paper: "mTOR inhibition promotes TFEB nuclear translocation"
  ✗ BAD: Function="TFEB Nuclear Translocation Promotion", Arrow="activates"
         (Redundant and wordy)
  ✓ GOOD: Function="TFEB Nuclear Translocation", Arrow="activates"
          (Clear and concise)

Paper: "HDAC6 enhances protein aggregate clearance"
  ✗ BAD: Function="Protein Aggregate Clearance Enhancement", Arrow="activates"
  ✓ GOOD: Function="Protein Aggregate Clearance", Arrow="activates"

WINNING PATTERN:
  - Name the TARGET PROCESS: "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Cell Cycle", "Transcription"
  - Let the ARROW indicate the EFFECT: "activates" or "inhibits"
  - Avoid verb forms: Remove -tion, -sion, -ment suffixes
  - Think: "What cellular process is being directly affected?"

REMEMBER:
- Function name = THE THING being affected (the target process)
- Arrow = HOW it's being affected (the direction of effect)
- Never use outcome verbs (Suppression, Activation, etc.) in function names
- The arrow already conveys activation/inhibition - don't duplicate it!

CLARITY TEST:
Read the function name + arrow aloud to a colleague.
If they get confused or have to re-read it → SIMPLIFY THE NAME.
If they immediately understand → Perfect!"""

INTERACTOR_TYPES = """╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  INTERACTOR CLASSIFICATION (DIRECT vs INDIRECT)              ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

⚠️  CRITICAL: Classification is SET in Phase 1 and PRESERVED throughout pipeline!
You MUST classify EACH interactor based on EVIDENCE TYPE (not just description).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DIRECT INTERACTORS (Physical/Molecular Binding)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Evidence types that indicate DIRECT interaction:**
✓ Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
✓ Pull-down assays (GST pull-down, FLAG-tag, etc.)
✓ Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)
✓ BioID proximity labeling
✓ Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
✓ Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
✓ Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
✓ Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS)
✓ Structural data (X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM showing complex)
✓ Fluorescence polarization assays
✓ Native mass spectrometry
✓ Papers saying "binds to", "forms complex with", "interacts directly"

**How to classify:**
- If literature mentions ANY of the above assays → interaction_type: "direct"
- If papers explicitly say "direct interaction" → interaction_type: "direct"
- If structural data shows them in same complex → interaction_type: "direct"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INDIRECT INTERACTORS (Functional/Pathway Relationship)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Evidence types that indicate INDIRECT interaction:**
✓ Genetic epistasis (double mutant analysis)
✓ Pathway analysis without binding evidence
✓ Multi-step cascades (A → B → C means A and C are indirect)
✓ Transcriptional regulation (unless TF-DNA binding shown directly)
✓ Functional assays (phosphorylation, ubiquitination) without binding evidence
✓ Papers saying "regulates", "modulates", "affects" WITHOUT binding data
✓ Downstream in signaling pathway
✓ Identified through RNA-seq, proteomics, but no binding shown

**How to classify:**
- If protein appears in CASCADE description → interaction_type: "indirect"
  - Example: "VCP activates mTOR which phosphorylates S6K"
  - S6K is INDIRECT (through mTOR)
- If only functional relationship shown → interaction_type: "indirect"
- If papers say "indirectly regulates" → interaction_type: "indirect"

**For INDIRECT interactors, you MUST set:**
- interaction_type: "indirect"
- upstream_interactor: "<protein that mediates the connection>" OR null

**Two types of indirect interactors:**

1. **Multi-hop indirect** (mediator known):
   - Example: VCP → mTOR → S6K means S6K has upstream_interactor: "mTOR"
   - Set: interaction_type="indirect", upstream_interactor="mTOR"

2. **First-ring indirect** (mediator unknown):
   - Example: VCP functionally regulates TFEB but direct mediator not elucidated
   - Evidence: Only functional assays ("VCP regulates TFEB nuclear translocation")
   - Set: interaction_type="indirect", upstream_interactor=null
   - This indicates indirect relationship exists but pathway is incomplete

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION TREE FOR CLASSIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For EACH interactor, ask:

1. **Does literature mention Co-IP, Y2H, BioID, or other binding assay?**
   → YES: interaction_type = "direct"
   → NO: Continue to question 2

2. **Does literature explicitly say "binds to" or "forms complex"?**
   → YES: interaction_type = "direct"
   → NO: Continue to question 3

3. **Is protein mentioned in multi-step cascade (A→B→C)?**
   → YES: interaction_type = "indirect", set upstream_interactor to mediator
   → NO: Continue to question 4

4. **Does literature only show functional relationship ("regulates", "affects")?**
   → YES: interaction_type = "indirect", upstream_interactor = null (first-ring indirect)
   → NO: Default to "direct" if clearly connected, omit if uncertain

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example 1: VCP and NPLOC4
Literature: "Co-IP shows VCP forms a complex with NPLOC4 and UFD1L"
→ Classification: interaction_type = "direct" (Co-IP evidence)

Example 2: VCP and S6K
Literature: "VCP activates mTORC1, which phosphorylates S6K"
→ Classification: interaction_type = "indirect", upstream_interactor = "mTORC1"
→ Reasoning: S6K is downstream in cascade, no direct binding evidence

Example 3: VCP and LAMP2
Literature: "VCP regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion through LC3"
→ Classification: interaction_type = "indirect", upstream_interactor = "LC3"
→ Reasoning: LAMP2 affected through LC3, no VCP-LAMP2 binding shown

Example 4: p53 and MDM2
Literature: "Y2H screen identified MDM2 as p53-binding partner"
→ Classification: interaction_type = "direct" (Y2H evidence)

Example 5: VCP and TFEB (FIRST-RING INDIRECT)
Literature: "VCP regulates TFEB nuclear translocation in response to starvation"
→ Classification: interaction_type = "indirect", upstream_interactor = null
→ Reasoning: Only functional relationship shown ("regulates"), no binding evidence
→ Mediator unknown: VCP affects TFEB but direct mediator not elucidated in literature
→ This is first-ring indirect: indirect by nature, but no mediator specified

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before outputting, verify:
✓ EVERY interactor has interaction_type: "direct" or "indirect"
✓ INDIRECT interactors have upstream_interactor set to mediator OR null if unknown
✓ Classification matches evidence type (not just paper phrasing)
✓ Cascade proteins are marked indirect with proper upstream
