While ATXN3 is correctly identified as a deubiquitinase for RHEB, its role in the context of mTORC1 signaling is misrepresented. The literature shows that amino acids *block* ATXN3's deubiquitinase activity at the lysosome. This allows RHEB to become polyubiquitinated, which *enhances* its binding to and activation of mTORC1. Therefore, ATXN3's activity is inhibitory to mTORC1 activation, but the overall claim that ATXN3 deubiquitinates RHEB to inhibit mTORC1 is the opposite of the described mechanism for activation. The claim has been corrected to reflect the actual biological process.",
