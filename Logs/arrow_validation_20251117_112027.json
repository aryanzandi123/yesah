Therefore, ATXN3's activity is inhibitory to mTORC1 activation, but the overall claim that ATXN3 deubiquitinates RHEB to inhibit mTORC1 is the opposite of the described mechanism for activation.

Search results confirm UBQLN2 binds to TDP-43 and enhances its clearance, thereby lowering its levels. Some evidence also suggests UBQLN2 can protect certain proteins from degradation. Given this complexity, 'regulates' is a more accurate and neutral term for the overall interaction than 'activates' or 'inhibits'.",

While UBQLN2 activates the process of TDP-43 clearance, its direct effect on the TDP-43 protein is to mediate its degradation, which is a form of negative regulation. Search results confirm UBQLN2 binds to TDP-43 and enhances its clearance, thereby lowering its levels. Some evidence also suggests UBQLN2 can protect certain proteins from degradation. Given this complexity, 'regulates' is a more accurate and neutral term for the overall interaction than 'activates' or 'inhibits'.",
