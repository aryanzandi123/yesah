The paper shows that depletion of Atxn3 in mouse retina and knockdown in human cells leads to decreased levels and destabilization of KEAP1, and a corresponding increase in NRF2 levels. All fields of the function box are consistent with these findings and canonical knowledge of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway.",
